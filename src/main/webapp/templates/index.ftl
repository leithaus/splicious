        or professional community, we think Synereo might be for
        you. Check out the video to find out more.</p>

      <h2 style="color:gold;background-color:black">!!! Important announcement !!!</h2>
      <h3 style="font-style:italic;color:purple">Splicious crowdfund contributors will receive grants of AMPs in recognition of their support for the project.</h3>
      <i><p>Dear Spliciously Supportive Contributor,</p>

      <p>Last year, right about this time, you were kind and generous
      enough to donate to the Splicious crowdfunding campaign. While
      that didn’t meet the goal, the donations were enough to keep the
      project alive. Then we met up with the Synereo team and it was a
      perfect match. They had greatly elaborated the Splicious
      economic model, re-envisioning it as the attention economy
      model, driven by your attention and the AMP cryptocurrency
      token. Likewise, after some considerable technical due
      diligence, they found our tech stack to be the one best suited
      to realize their approach. So, the two projects merged.</p>

      <p>We kept the Synereo name (frankly, they had better branding,
      and a much more talented designer, Noy Konforty). This month
      we’ve issued the AMPs tokens, and as a token of our appreciation
      of your support we are granting you AMPs. You will be receiving
      and email about the details of your AMPs grant. AMPs will soon
      be tradeable, but we do hope to be seeing you use them in
      Synereo when we launch the alpha.</p>

      <p>Thanks again for believing in our project.</p>

      <p>With love,</p>

      <p>--greg</p></i>
