      <center><h2>Synereo for the creative, security conscious, ad-sensitive you</h2></center>
      <p>If you make music, write stories, make up recipes, design
        contraptions, and just generally create cool stuff, and you want to
        share it and find a community who wants to support what you do, we
        think Synereo might be for you. Check out the video to find out
        more.</p>
      <p>If you love the Internet, but are a little worried about who
        all can see the communications meant for your friends, family,
        or professional community, we think Synereo might be for
        you. Check out the video to find out more.</p>
      <p>If you don't like ads and you feel like your social media
        feed is overrun and you have no real way to structure what you
        see there, then Synereo might be for you. What's the next
        line? You guessed it! Check out the video to find out
        more!</p>
