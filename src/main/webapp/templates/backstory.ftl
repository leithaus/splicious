<center><h2>A story worth telling...</h2></center>

<p>Around 2009, a small group of entrepreneurs, who mostly prefer to remain anonymous, became concerned with a couple of trends that seemed to fit together to create a dangerous imbalance.</p>

<p>On the one hand, privacy and information flow in Internet-based communications has been severely compromised, with corporate and government agencies being able to access and profit by personally identifiable information and no real corresponding transparency on the part of these agencies to balance the situation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, capital has been concentrating in such a small sector of society as to virtually cease to perform its principal function: provide a tool whereby we can all take care of each other and the planet.</p>

<p>We set out to build an alternative Internet-scale social communications platform to address both trends. Beginning from a sound mathematical theory that informs both a notion of distributed identity and the software architecture, we've built a distributed communications fabric designed to allow people to be in control of who sees their communications and who profits by them.</p>

<center><h3>How BitCoin changes the equation</h3></center>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aM5OIJWOyW89rHdUg6d9-YVbItdtxxiosP_fXZQaRdg/edit#heading=h.ndihpob06tu0">While i'm certainly very excited about the maths, and the way it simplifies the programming</a>, i'm equally excited about the possibility that this platform can help people find alternative ways of supporting each other directly. You see, we knew that the network was eventually going to have to become self-sustaining economically, and wanted to find a model that didn't interfere with the fundamentally distributed nature of the system. With the emergence of BitCoin (BTC) we feel we've found a solution.</p>

<p>Knowing that the corporate exchange of personal information (including personally identifiable information) is a >9B USD market, we feel it should be possible to turn the whole model on its head. Having already put a novel social media UI on the front end of our communications platform, allowing for people to search communications in their social network to which they have access, we realized we could just let people decide for themselves how much that information was worth to them, and using BTC, directly support people who provided them with information they found valuable.</p>

<center><h3>How this benefits the creative class</h3></center>
<p>For example, David Torn, internationally recognized guitarist, recently posted that in exchange for hundreds of thousands of plays of one of his tunes, Pandora paid him 8$. If this trend continues, this class of musician will simply not be able to support themselves through their craft.In our system, if David shares one of his tunes with his friends, family, and fans, then they can respond to David's post with a show of support, transmitting to David the number of BTC they feel is appropriate for their situation and connection to David. If David has 10K such connections, and each only gave 99c, then David would make ~10K$ for his tune. Further, if one of David's friends re-shares the tune, and one of their connections showed support for the content, David's friend would get a very small percentage, with the rest flowing to David.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not just for sharing music. It's for any digital content. A journalist could be supported for dispatches from a hotspot like the Middle East or Central Africa.</p>

<center><h3>How this solves the problem</h3></center>
<p>We feel our approach directly addresses the trends that made us feel uncomfortable. The system is completely distributed, there is no centralized entity, like a FB or Google or a Twitter that is gathering and sifting through people's personal communications. And, yet, unlike these entities, today, we offer people a safe and secure way to search content to which they have access. Isn't this what we use our social network for anyway: Hey does anybody know a good doctor? A good mechanic?</p>

<p>And, the system allows people to decide for themselves what content and what content providers they wish to support. They do not have to bear the intrusion of advertisers or other entities who are normally called in to monetize the communications platform and make it sustainable. Further, by using BTC, we do not pay Wall St a red cent. No money from this system need to go to a system that has already proven itself bankrupt morally and fiscally, a system that is really and truly supported by the tax payers.</p>

<center><h3>People already have the means to address their situation</h3></center>
<p>To end on a positive note, through the bailout of 2008 and 2009 ordinary people have shown the enormity of their good will and that they have the means to support a global financial network. Instead of transferring their good will and their hard earned money into the hands of people who have failed them, repeatedly, why not give them the means to support each other? This has been one of the principal motivators to me in building this solution.</p>

<p>There are some very important differences between Splicious and what other social media platforms do. The fact that a user can search all the communications they have access to; and they can send and receive BitCoin as support for sharing content means the bar is much higher for splicious. This is why we have to roll the service out in a very careful, step-by-step fashion and why we are only allowing 1000 users initially. It's also part of the reason we are asking for crowd funding for this first step. At this point we've put four years of our lives and a considerable chunk of our collective wealth into the solution. For it to become real, though, we know that people have to help us get it the rest of the way. Now is the most exciting time of the whole venture!
